How to run the http-server in OSX?
cd /usr/local/Cellar/node/0.12.2_1/libexec/npm/lib/node_modules/http-server
node bin/http-server /Users/shian_mac/shian-project/mysite

How to set up the project?
1. git clone the project, then run npm install, this command will create a package.json, later we can add dependencies to package.json, whenever we run npm install,
those dependencies will be downloaded to node_modules folder.
2. Create Gruntfile.js, add some tasks in that file, then run grunt command, this command will run all tasks defined in the Gruntfile.js, also it compiles source code to a destination file
3. Run http-server to host the app, the compiled file will be hosted.
